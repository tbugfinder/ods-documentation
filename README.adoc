# The ODS Antora Playbook Repository

## Building documentation locally

### Prerequisites

- Antora (2.2) has to be installed according to the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/install/install-antora/[Install Antora] guide.
- The following OpenDevStack repositories have to be cloned and stored beside the `ods-documentation` repository: `ods-core`, `ods-jenkins-shared-library`, `ods-provisioning-app` and `ods-quickstarters`.

### Generate docs using `site-workspace.yml`

To preview your local changes, just building documentation from `HEAD`.

   antora generate site-workspace.yml

The output will be written to `docs_local`, which is ignored by git. This directory is only for local preview and verification.

### Generate docs using `site-workspace-full.yml`

To preview your local changes, taking into account all branches.

   antora generate site-workspace-full.yml

The output will be written to `docs_local`, which is ignored by git. This directory is only for local preview and verification.

Note that for this playbook, you will also need the following repositories locally:

- `opendevstack.github.io`
- `ods-project-quickstarters`

### Customize the UI

By default, the playbooks reference a UI bundle from https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-docs-ui/releases. You can also clone that repo locally, customize the UI, build a new UI bundle and reference that when running `antora`.

To build a UI bundle, read the documentation at
https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-docs-ui/blob/ods-docs-ui/README.adoc. Example:

    cd ../ods-docs-ui
    # Compile
    npm install
    # Create file ui-bundle.zip
    gulp bundle
    # Reference it
    cd ../ods-documentation
    antora generate site-workspace.yml --ui-bundle-url ../ods-docs-ui/build/ui-bundle.zip

### Search Function

A search index is created by integration of https://github.com/Mogztter/antora-lunr. The argument `--generator antora-site-generator-lunr` has to be passed to antora when running the build. Search UI can be customized by changing files in `supplemental-ui`. Initially those files are copies of https://github.com/Mogztter/antora-lunr/tree/master/supplemental_ui.

## Building using GitHub Actions

Whenever this repository is pushed to GitHub, it triggers a build using GitHub Actions,
that regenerates the antora documentation based on the `site.yml` playbook (which fetches the different referenced repositories from GitHub). The
updated content in directory `docs` will be pushed back to the GitHub repository during the build. The build environment requires access to a GitHub Token (env: GH_TOKEN) with write privileges to the repository.

See xref:.github/workflows/renderDocs.yml[.github/workflows/renderDocs.yml] for details.
