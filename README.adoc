# The ODS Antora Playbook Repository

## Building documentation locally

### Prerequisites

#### Antora
Antora has to be installed according to the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.0/install/install-antora/[Install Antora] guide.

#### OpenDevStack Repositories
The following OpenDevStack Repositories have to be cloned and stored beside the _ods-documentation_ repository:

- opendevstack.github.io
- ods-core
- ods-jenkins-shared-library
- ods-provisioning-app
- ods-project-quickstarters
- ods-docs-ui

Take care that _../ods-docs-ui/build/ui-bundle.zip_ has been build before. If you are not already
familar with _ods-docs-ui_ project, a closer look at the documentation at
https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-docs-ui/blob/ods-docs-ui/README.adoc
and the following hint may help to create the requiered zip-file:

    cd ../ods-docs-ui
    # compile
    npm install
    # create file ui-bundle.zip
    gulp bundle


#### PlantUML-Server

Because we use PlantUML for creating of diagrams, it is important, that a plantuml server is running.
Currently the system is configured to use a local plantuml server when building locally.
Plantuml server can be downloaded from https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server. It runs as
docker container or can be started with a jetty server out of the box. See the documentation at
github and the following explanations for details.


*Start as Docker container:*

You can start a server using a docker container

    docker run -d -p 9080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty

Then you are able to generate the documentation.

*Start as jetty server via maven*:

    mvn jetty:run -Djetty.port=9080 -Djetty.contextpath=/

*Classic way (not recommend)*:

Since PlantUML is a simple web application, you can even go the classic way and build a war - archive
and deploy it to your java application server.


### Run the build locally
The documentation build is defined by a playbook.
There are 3 different playbook versions with different behavior.

#### Fetch content from github
  antora generate site.yml

This fetches the different referenced repositories from github and caches them locally.

#### Use local repositories
If you want to preview your local changes, you can use

   antora generate site-workspace.yml

or

   antora generate site-workspace-full.yml

The difference is that the latter will take into account all branches, the first option will only build the last branch.
Both assume that all ods projects are located side-by-side.

Both playbooks _site-workspace.yml_ and _site-workspace-full.yml_ are configured to write the outout
in the local directory _docs_local_, which is ignored by git. This directory is only for local
preview and verification.



## Building on travis

Whenever this repository is pushed to github, it triggers a travis build,
that regenerates the antora documentation based on the `site.yml` playbook. The
updated content in directory docs will be pushed back to the githup repository during the build.

See xref:.travis.yml[.travis.yml] for details.
